# DOM-Array-Methods
My JS projects on my journey to learn this awesome language.

Hey, I am on a journey to learn JavaScript and this will be my first project to get more familiar with -

- forEach()
- map()
- reduce()
- sort()
- filter()

I have built a small application using these Array Methods.

- fetched random users from "https://randomuser.me/api" API
- forEach to add new users to the array and update DOM
- map to double everyones money
- reduce to calculate the total wealth
- sort to sort users by richest
- filter to filter out millionaires
